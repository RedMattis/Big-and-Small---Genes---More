For best effect use along with Humanoid Alien Races if possible.

If you don't use HAR you'll use a full-featured, but less pretty result with some minor hickups, Without HAR I'd also suggest at using a head/face mod such as Vanilla Facial Animations or you may get pawn heads not scaling properly.

Erhm.

This mod adds a whole bunch of Biotech Genes and Traits mostly related to modifying the pawn size. This core mod includes genes, traits, and the C# framework to make things in my other mods work. If you want races, factions, etc. see the Big and Small Races mod.
